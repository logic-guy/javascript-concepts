### Creating New Translation

In order to create a new translation, you need to follow these steps:

* Fork the [main repo](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts).
* Add yourself to the watch list of the main repo, to keep up with changes.
* When translating topics, **create NEW directory with suffix of your language in folder topics**.
  * For example, Spanish tranlation for `topics/en/sql.md` will be on `topics/es/sql.md`.
* Create `topics/*YOUR_LANG*/readme.md` like [original README](readme.md)
* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts/issues/new) and ask to be part of the organization.
* Transfer the repo to the organization.
* Merge new content from the main repo.
* Keep translating...
* Rinse/repeat last two steps until a topics is done.
